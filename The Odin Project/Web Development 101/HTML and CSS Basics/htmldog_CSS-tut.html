            pt is for points, the unit typically used in printed media <br>
            % is for percentage <br>
            there are also pc (picas), cm, mm, and inches <br>

            CSS uses RGB colors in the form of 
            <ul>
                <li>color name (very limited, ie. red)</li>
                <li>rgb(int,int,int), where int is 0-255 inclusive</li>
                <li>rgb(%,%,%)</li>
                <li>#hexadecimal with six or three digits that also correspond to rgb</li>
            </ul>
            Can even define things like hue, saturation, transparency. Google for tnat stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            can define font-family (ie. Arial and Times New Roman) <br>
            can import custom fonts as well <br>
            can manipulate font-size <br>
            can also bold things with font-weight. Google for all ways to manipulate font. <br>
            can use text-decoration to underline, overline, etc. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            margin and padding are two of the most used properties for spacing out elements. <br>
            margin is for space outside something <br>
            padding is for space inside something <br>
            These properties are based on the following box model.
        </p>
        <div id="boxmodel" style="color: #a06700; margin: 20px 0; overflow: auto; padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px; background-color: #e90;">
                Margin box
                <div style="padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px; margin: 10px 20px 20px 20px; background-color: #f4bb55;">
                    Border box
                    <div style="padding: 10px 20px 20px 20px; margin: 10px 20px 20px 20px; background-color: #f9ddaa;">
                        Padding box
                        <div style="padding: 20px; margin: 10px 20px 20px 20px; background-color: #fff;">
                            Element box
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        <p>
            There different border-style, such as solid, dotted, ridged, etc. <br>
            There's also border-width and border-color <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            there are class selectors, which use ".", and ID selectors, which use "#", in CSS. <br>
            an ID is for only one element, while a class can be used for multiple elements. <br>
            Can also select specific elements with a specific class. <br>
            For example, p.good would only be applied to paragraph elements with the class "good"
        </p>
        <p>
            For elements/ID/class that you want to have the same properties, can just separate by commas <br>
            For example, h1, .class1, #ID1 {properties}
        </p>
        <p>
            properties can also be nested. <br>
            for example, if you want all #bad to have "background-color: orange" and all h2 with #bad to have "color:gray", you can do this: <br>
            #bad { background-color: orange } <br>
            #bad h2 {color:orange} <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            properties can also be applied to pseudoclasses in the format of selector:pseudo_class {prop} <br>
            For example, a:link and a:visited <br>
            there are also dynamic pseudo classes such as <br>
            active: when something is activated (like clicking) <br>
            hover: when something is passed over by an input (like cursor moving over) <br>
            focus: when something is selected (such as selecting by keyboard) <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first-child pseudo class is literally what it means. <br>
            It styles the first child, such as the first paragraph of a body <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are short-hand ways to designate properties. <br>
            For example, the margin-top to margin-left can just be <br>
            margin: top right bottom left (clockwise) <br>
            it's the same for borders. border: width color style <br>
            also for font: style weight size height family
        </p>
        <p>
            Background images can be made with <br>
            background: color image repeat position <br>
            image is in the form of url(image url) 
        </p>
        <p>
            In CSS more specificity means greater precedence <br>
            calculating it is a hassle, Google when needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few display types: <br>
            inline: displayed in a line <br>
            block: each box takes up a line <br>
            inline-block: a more customizable inline <br>
            there are also display types for tables. Google them if needed <br>
            use list-item to display boxes in a list, nested within ul or ol. 
        </p>
        <p>
            use selector::pseudo_element to designate <br>
            examples are first-line and first-letter <br>
            can also designate before and after <br>
            coupled with the content property, which can be: <br>
            open-quote, close-quote, string in quotes, or image 
        </p>
        <p>
            position property can be applied to a box <br>
            static: default value, where it's in normal order <br>
            relative: static, but can designate top, right, bottom, left <br>
            absolute: can be placed in absolute positions of the page (same 4 positions) <br>
            fixed: absolute, but with respect to browser window. <br>
