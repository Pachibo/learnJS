I started on the [Web Development 101 module](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) on TOP and stopped at "2. HTML and CSS Basics".

In addition, I also did the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), where I learned how React works.

I plan on learning JavaScript and begin on making a connect four game tomorrow.
