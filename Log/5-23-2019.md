I took a break yesterday, but I continued learning JS today.

I felt like I did not understand HTML/CSS too well, so I took notes on the beginner HTML tutorial and the beginner/intermediate CSS tutorials on htmldog.

In addition, I also went through JS Fundamentals Part 1-4 on TOP. I did not take notes on Part 4, because I already went over arrays in my data structures and algorithms course. Arrays in JS are not too different except that they can contain different types of objects/primitives.

I also made the rock paper scissors game using JS, and I may make a UI for it tomorrow.
